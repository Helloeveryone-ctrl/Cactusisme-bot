# CactusismeBot
CactusismeBot is an automated bot that scans pages on Simple English Wikipedia and removes red-linked templates (templates that are broken or missing). Its goal is to maintain cleaner and more accurate pages.

## Features
- Identifies and removes red-linked templates (`{{TemplateName}}`) from any page.
- Logs its actions and errors for monitoring and debugging.
- Automatically runs periodically to keep pages updated.
